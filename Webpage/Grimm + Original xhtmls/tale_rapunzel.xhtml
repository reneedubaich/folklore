            <h3>Rapunzel  (1812) </h3>
            <p> There were once a man and a woman who <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="maternal" gender="female">wished for a child</characteristic></span>.
                At length the
               woman hoped <span class="female">
                  <autonomy xmlns="" level="religious" gender="female">that God was about to grant her
                     desire</autonomy></span>. These people had a little window at the back of their house from
               which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers
               and
               herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it
               because it
               belonged to an enchantress , <span class="female">
                  <autonomy xmlns="" level="evil" gender="female">who had great power</autonomy></span> and was <span class="female">
                  <villainization xmlns="" cause="power" gender="female">
                     <!-- your tags are good but im not too sure if you have to tag the gender with every element -->dreaded
                     by all the world</villainization></span>. One day the woman was standing by this window and
               looking down into the garden, when <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="beauty" gender="female">she
                     saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion - rapunzel , and it looked
                     so fresh and green that she longed for it</characteristic></span>, and had the greatest desire
               to eat some. This desire increased every day
               ,
               and as she knew that she could not get any of it, <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" char_type="physical" gender="female">she quite pined away, and began to look pale and
                     miserable</characteristic></span>.Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, <span class="quote"><q>what ails
                     you, dear wife.</q></span>
               <span class="quote"><q>Ah,</q></span> she replied, <span class="quote"><q>if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the
                     garden behind our house, I shall die .</q></span> The man, who loved her
               thought, <span class="male">
                  <autonomy xmlns="" level="male_savior" gender="male">sooner than let your wife die, bring
                     her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will</autonomy></span>. At twilight, he
               clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress ,<span class="male">
                  <autonomy xmlns="" level="male_savior" gender="male"> hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to
                     his wife</autonomy></span>. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it
               <span class="adj">
                  <adjective xmlns="">greedily</adjective></span>. It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next
               day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her
               husband
               must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let
               himself
               down again. But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he
               saw the
               enchantress standing before him.<span class="quote"><q><span class="female">
                        <villainization xmlns="" cause="revenge" gender="female">How
                           can you dare, said she with angry<!-- adjective --> look, descend into my garden and
                           steal my rampion like a thief. You shall suffer for it.</villainization></span></q></span>
               <span class="quote"><q>Ah,</q></span> answered he, <span class="quote"><q>let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up
                     my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt
                     such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat." Then
                     the
                     enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him,</q></span>
               <span class="quote"><q><span class="female">
                        <villainization xmlns="" cause="revenge" gender="female">if the case be as you say, I will
                           allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one
                           condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world.
                           
                           <characteristic depiction="maternal" gender="female"> It shall be well treated,
                              and I will care for it like a mother.</characteristic>"</villainization></span></q></span>
               The man in his terror consented to
               everything, and when the woman
               was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of rapunzel
               ,
               <span class="female">
                  <villainization xmlns="" cause="revenge" gender="female">and took it away with
                     her</villainization></span>.Rapunzel grew into <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="beauty" gender="female">the most beautiful child under the sun</characteristic></span>. When
               <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" age="young" gender="female">she was twelve years old</characteristic></span>,
               the enchantress <span class="female">
                  <autonomy xmlns="" auto_type="controlled" gender="female">
                     <characteristic depiction="secluded" gender="female">shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest,
                        and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little
                        window.</characteristic>
                  </autonomy></span> When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed
               herself beneath it and cried, <span class="quote"><q>rapunzel , rapunzel , let down your hair to me.</q></span>
               Rapunzel had <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" char_type="physical" gender="female">magnificent long hair,
                     fine as spun gold,</characteristic></span> and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she
               unfastened <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" char_type="physical" gender="female">her braided tresses, wound
                     them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells
                     down</characteristic></span>, and the enchantress climbed up by it.</p>
            <p>After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode through the forest and
               passed
               by the tower.Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened.
               This was rapunzel , who in her solitude passed her time
               in<span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="innocent" gender="female"> letting 
                     <characteristic depiction="beauty" gender="female">her sweet voice</characteristic>
                     resound</characteristic></span> The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the
               door of the tower, but none was to be found . He rode home, but the
               singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest
               and
               listened to it.Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress
               came
               there, and he heard how she cried, <span class="quote"><q>rapunzel , rapunzel , let down your
                     hair.</q></span></p>
            <p>Then rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her.
               If that
               is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune , said he, and
               the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried, <span class="quote"><q>rapunzel ,
                     rapunzel , let down your hair.</q></span></p>
            <p> Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up. At first rapunzel was
               terribly
               frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld ,
               came to her. But the king's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told
               her that
               his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest
               , and he<span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="beauty" gender="female"> had been forced to see her</characteristic></span>
               .
               Then rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband,
               and she saw that he was <span class="male">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" age="young" gender="male">young</characteristic></span>
               and <span class="male">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="beauty" gender="male">handsome</characteristic></span>, she thought,
               he will love me more than <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" age="old" gender="female">old</characteristic></span>
               dame gothel does . And she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said,
               <span class="quote"><q>I will willingly go away with you, <span class="female">
                        <autonomy xmlns="" auto_type="free" gender="female">
                           but I do not know how to get down.</autonomy></span>" </q></span>
               <span class="quote"><q>Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder
                     with it, and when <span class="female">
                        <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="domesticity" gender="female">that is ready
                           I will descend, and you will take me on your horse</characteristic></span>.</q></span> They
               agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" age="old" gender="female">woman</characteristic></span> came by day. The enchantress remarked
               nothing of this, until once rapunzel said to her, <span class="quote"><q>tell me, dame gothel , how it
                     happens that <span class="female">
                        <characteristic xmlns="" char_type="physical" gender="female">you are so much

                      for me to draw up than the young king's son  - he
                     is with me in a moment.</q></span>
               <span class="quote"><q>Ah. You wicked child,</q></span> cried the enchantress . <span class="quote"><q>What do I hear you say.

            <p>On the same day that she cast out rapunzel ,however, the enchantress fastened the

               hair, which she had cut off , to the hook of the window, and
               when the king's son came and cried, <span class="quote"><q>rapunzel , rapunzel , let down your hair,she let

            <p>The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest rapunzel , he found the
