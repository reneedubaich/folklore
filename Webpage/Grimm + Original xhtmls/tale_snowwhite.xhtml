            <h3>Little Snow-white  (1812) </h3>
            <p>Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like
               feathers
               from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made
               of black
               ebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, <span class="childbirth">
                  <reproduction xmlns="" rep_type="childbirth"> she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood
                     fell upon the snow. </reproduction></span> And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she
               thought to herself, <span class="quote"><q> Would that I had a <span class="physical">
                        <characteristic xmlns="" char_type="physical"> child as
                           
                           <adjective gender="female"> white as snow, </adjective> as 
                           <reproduction rep_type="menstruation">red as blood, </reproduction> and as black as the wood of the
                           window-frame. </characteristic></span>
                     </q></span>
               </p>
            <p>Soon after that she had a <span class="physical">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" char_type="physical">
                     
                     <adjective gender="female"> little </adjective> daughter, who was as

                     <reproduction rep_type="menstruation"> red as blood </reproduction>, and her hair was as black as
                     ebony; </characteristic></span> and she was therefore called <span class="female">
                  <adjective xmlns="" gender="female"> Little
                     </adjective></span> Snow-white. And when the child was born, the Queen died.</p>
            <p>After a year had passed the King took to himself another wife. She was <span class="beauty">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="beauty"> a beautiful woman, but 
                     <adjective gender="female"> proud and haughty
                        </adjective>, and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty.
                     </characteristic></span> She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and
               looked at herself in it, and said— <span class="competition">
                  <villainization xmlns="" cause="competition">
                     
                     <quote>Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the 
                        <adjective gender="female"> fairest </adjective> of all? </quote> the looking-glass answered—
                     
                     <quote> Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all! </quote>
                     </villainization></span> Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the
               truth.</p>
            <p><span class="beauty">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="beauty"> But Snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more

                     </characteristic></span> And once when the Queen asked her looking-glass— <span class="competition">

                     green with envy. From that hour, whenever she looked at Snow-white, her heart heaved
                     in her
                     breast, she 
                     <adjective gender="female"> hated </adjective> the girl so much.

                     grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had no peace day or night.
                     She
                     called a huntsman, and said,

               was no longer needful for him to kill her. And as a young boar just then came running
               by he
               stabbed it, and cut out its heart and took it to the Queen as proof that the child
               was dead.
               The cook had to salt this, and <span class="revenge">

                     that she looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not know what to do. Then she
                     began to
                     run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, </autonomy></span> and the wild beasts ran past

               cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told. There was a table on which
               was a
               white cover, and seven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon; moreover,
               there were
               seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood seven
               little beds
               side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.</p>

                     hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from each plate and drank
                     a drop
                     of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only. Then, as
                     she was
                     so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of them suited
                     her; one
                     was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was right,
                     and
                     so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep. </autonomy></span>
               </p>
            <p>When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back; they were seven dwarfs
               who dug and
               delved in the mountains for ore. They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light
               within
               the cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything was not in the same
               order in
               which they had left it.</p>
            <p>The first said, <span class="quote"><q> Who has been sitting on my chair? </q></span> The second, <span class="quote"><q> Who has
                     been eating off my plate? </q></span> The third, <span class="quote"><q> Who has been taking some of my bread?
                     </q></span> The fourth, <span class="quote"><q> Who has been eating my vegetables? </q></span> The fifth, <span class="quote"><q>
                     Who has been using my fork? </q></span> The sixth, <span class="quote"><q> Who has been cutting with my knife?
                     </q></span> The seventh, <span class="quote"><q> Who has been drinking out of my mug? </q></span>
               </p>
            <p>Then the first looked round and saw that there was a <span class="female">
                  <adjective xmlns="" gender="female"> little

               The others came up and each called out, <span class="quote"><q> Somebody has been lying in my bed too.</q></span>
               But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw <span class="female">
                  <adjective xmlns="" gender="female"> little </adjective></span>
               Snow-white, who was lying asleep therein. And he called the others, who came running
               up, and
               they cried out with astonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the
               light
               fall on <span class="innocent">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="innocent"> little Snow-white. </characteristic></span>
               <span class="quote"><q> Oh, heavens! oh, heavens! </q></span> cried they, <span class="quote"><q>

                     </q></span> and they were so glad that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the
               bed.
               And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through
               the
               night.</p>
            <p>When it was morning <span class="innocent">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="innocent"> little Snow-white </characteristic></span>
               awoke, and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly and
               asked her
               what her name was. <span class="quote"><q> My name is Snow-white, </q></span> she answered. <span class="quote"><q> How have you
                     come to our house? </q></span> said the dwarfs. Then she told them that her step-mother had
               wished to have her killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she
               had run for
               the whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling. The dwarfs said, <span class="quote"><q>

            <p>In days of yore, and in times long gone before, there lived a baron of Serva-Scura,
               and he had a <span class="female">
                  <characteristic xmlns="" depiction="beauty" gender="female"> young sister, a

               and they agreed to wager that whosoever should jump clear above the tree without damaging
               the rose would win so much. Then the
               damsels began to jump one after the other, but none could clear the tree; till it
               coming to
               Cilia's turn (thus was the baron's sister hight), she took a little longer distance,
               and ran
               quickly, and jumped, and cleared the tree without touching the rose, and only a single
               leaf fell
               to the ground. <span class="female">

            <p><span class="female">
                  <villainization xmlns="" cause="sex" gender="female"> Three days had hardly passed, when she felt that she was with
                     child, and finding that such was the case she nearly died with grief, well wotting
                     that she had
                     done naught to bring such a catastrophe upon her, and she could not suppose in any
                     way how this
                     had occurred. Therefore she ran to the house of some fairies, her friends, and relating
                     to them
                     her case, they told her that there was no doubt but that she was with child of the

                     swallowed. </villainization></span> </p>
            <p>Cilia hearing this hid her state as long as it was possible, but the time came at

                     felt cursed her, saying that when she should reach her seventh year, her mother in
                     combing her hair would forget the

               in despair at this great misfortune, and after weeping and wailing, ordered seven
               crystal chests one within the other,
               and had her child put within them, and then the chest was laid in a distant chamber
               in the
               palace; and she kept the key in her pocket.</p>
            <p>But daily after this her health failed, her cark and
               care bringing her to the last step of her life; and when she felt her end drawing
               near, she sent
               for her brother, and said to him, <span class="quote"><q> O my brother, I feel death slowly and surely come upon me,

                     consign to thee the key, which thou wilt keep within thy desk. </q></span> </p>
            <p>Her brother, who loved her
               dearly, gave her the required promise, and she bade him farewell and died.</p>
            <p>After a year had
               passed the baron took to himself a wife, and being one day invited to a hunt by some

                     But no sooner had he left the palace than dire suspicion

                     of
                     womankind), she took the key, and opened the door, and beheld the seven crystal chests,
