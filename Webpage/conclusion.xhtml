        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Through our research, we've found that women in folklore often follow the traditional
            social roles that were given to women: domestic life, reproductive capabilities, and
            being in a heteronormative relationship. While there are some outliers in our data,
            specifically, the renditions of "Sleeping Beauty," instead of reading this as a
            counterargument, we read it through a lens of hopefulness for female autonomical
            representations. Folktales have been read to us since we were children, and if we have
            stories that teach us to be brave in a range of situations, we mght feel empowered to
            break free of the domestic sphere and do so. However, regardless of the story and level
            of autonomy, each folktale has one thing in common: the pursuance of a male figure. This
            is a restricting role in and of itself, and shows us the heteronormative societies that
            we've examined, where women are expected (regardless of situation) to find a male to
            marry and settle down with. We hope that, in the future, these stories will continue to
            be adapted to have more representation and story options shown. <br /><br />There have
            been some modern adaptations to these folktales that seemingly give women the autonomy they
            deserve: see Angela Carter's "The Bloody Chamber." Our group originally wanted to
            examine how this text compared to the original fairy tales and how it gave women sexual
            freedom, but because of copyright laws, we were unable to do so.</p>
