        <p>Fairy tales are known by populations around the world and are notorious for their
            common tropes: a young woman in distress, an evil step-mother/witch, and a prince who
            saves the day. Yet, this distinct characterization of women
            perpetuates two polarized female identities: one that is pure and helpless or one that is
            evil and wicked. Using Diane Purkiss's chapter "No Limit: The body of the Witch" from
            her book <em>The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century
                Representations</em>, we will explain the foreground of these perceptions and how
            that is reflected in our folktales.</p>
     
        <br />
        <p> Each of these quasi-fantasical stories was written with a particular moral lesson in mind. The best known
            tales were compiled by German scholars, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, or as they came to be
            eponymously known: the Grimm Bros. Their desire to preserve cultural folklore has
            resulted in millions of children knowing the revised classical tales of Little Red
            Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Beauty and the Beast. These
            stories were not, however, creations of the brothers; instead, they were adaptations of
            stories that had previously existed. By going into the history of each text, we explain
            the translations that we used in our examination and how they were collected in
            antiquity. </p>

        <h2><b>The History of Our Texts in Translation</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Little Red Riding Hood</b>
        </h3>
        <p>The story of Little Red Riding Hood has its origins from French author and poet, Charles
            Perrault. Published in 1697 as part of a compendium of fairy tales, <em>Histoires ou
                contes du temps passé</em> (Stories or Tales from Past Times, with Morals), this
            story became a popular message for all young ladies: stay on the straight and narrow
            path of life, and be able to discern good from evil. Understanding that children needed
            easily digestible ways to understand complex lessons, Perrault is thought to have most
            likely modified a story that was already familiar to him. By highlighting the naivety of
            children and placing an emphasis on the evils that can happen if children aren't raised
            properly, he tells the young female audience to be wary of danger and avoid the pitfalls
            of pointless flattery. Sometimes evil does win out over goodness, and sometimes children
            do suffer -- specifically young, unaware girls.</p>
        <p>The Grimm Bros. version, however, offers an equally sinister lesson. Yes, children are
            susceptible to falling prey to the evil machinations of those who seek to manipulate and
            exploit, but often there is a hero who comes to save the day. Focusing less on the moral
            aspect of the tale and more on the consequences of disobedience, the Grimm’s version is
            more bleak. Little Red-Cap (as the tale is titled) is perhaps a little more cunning and
            less naive than the version told by Perrault. The prowling wolf, too, is far more
            aggressive and ultimately savage in his treatment of Little Red-Cap and her grandmother.
            His predatory nature has covert sexual undertones which points to a far more malevolent
            purpose. </p>
        <h3><b>Sleeping Beauty</b></h3>
        <p>Perrault incorporated multiple tales in his book which eventually became known as the
            Mother Goose Stories. The story of Sleeping Beauty, like Little Red Riding Hood, was
            part of his collection, and also offered a moral lesson. While Little Red Riding Hood
            was a warning against naivete , Sleeping Beauty was a cautionary tale about the
            consequences of disobedience. Again, Perrault most likely adapted stories that he had
            heard and that had been culturally circulated from the Scandinavians to the Italians.
            Perrault’s society valued children who were obedient and patient, and so he crafted this
            story to reflect the behaviors good children should model. Designed to entertain,
            Perrault’s story of Sleeping Beauty incorporated supernatural elements to emphasize, in
            particular, how young women can fall prey to dangerous situations should they give in to
            curiosity without forethought to any consequences.</p>
        <p>Little Briar-Rose, the Grimm Bros. version of Perrault’s story, focuses less on the moral
            implications of the dangers of curiosity and disobedience, and instead draws attention
            to the characters themselves. Working through the various actions of the characters (the
            obstacles overcome by the Prince, the desire for the King to protect his daughter), the
            Grimm version highlights what their society thought of women: empty-headed vessels that
            are unable to resist temptation, and instead require rescuing from themselves. Instead
            of a more applicable moral to perhaps model in society, the Grimm Bros. variation
            creates a glossy story where masculinity is seen as a virtue, and femininity is seen as
            a weakness. </p>
        <h3>Snow White</h3>
        <p> The story of Snow White can be traced back to Italy, 1634. Count Giambattista Basile
            compiled a number of stories in his book, “Lo cunto de il cunti overo lo trattenemiento
            de perccerille” (The Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones), and his story La
            Bella Venezia (The Beautiful Slave) was among them. Basile’s desire was to preserve his
            cultural heritage, and sought to do so by collecting local folklore so that it could be
            printed and distributed to the masses. Basile’s version draws from his Neopolitan
            heritage; his descriptions are earthy and rustic- reflections of the local populace.
            Basile is less inclined to craft a cautionary tale as seen in other fairy tales; his
            story instead focuses on the cultural values of the Napolese. They viewed themselves as
            cunning and resourceful, able to overcome obstacles with help from others but also with
            inner resilience.</p>
        <p> The Grimm Bros. version of The Beautiful Slave, Little Snow White, would have been known
            to them as part of German folklore. Their version, like Basile’s, incorporated themes of
            jealousy, purity, and innocence. Their maiden, however, again is relegated to helpness.
            Rural German folklore did not have a modern view of womanhood; a masculine dominated
            society influenced how the Grimm Bros. would have understood traditional gender roles.
            For them, Snow White could only seek assistance from comical characters; anything more
            may have shown a level of situational understanding. She also required rescuing; much
            like the majority of the women in the Grimm Bros. fairy tales, Snow White was helpless
            until kissed by a man. It could be argued that these character depictions were more
            archetypal than actual, but it does remain an authentic reflection of the time period in
            which it was written. </p>
        <h3>Rapunzel</h3>
        <p>Basile authored another story, Petrosinella, which mirrors the Grimm Bros. story of
            Rapunzel. Much as he did with The Beautiful Slave, Basile wrote primarily to entertain,
            but also to record cultural stories so that they could be enjoyed forever. Reflective of
            society, this story highlights an authority structure that the Napolese would have
            recognized: those in power could make absolute demands of those who were not in power.
            This tale also served to showcase the strength of the family structure (corrupt as it
            may have been). Loyalty to family was paramount; in a culture that eventually spawned
            the rise of the infamous mafia, it should be no surprise that their folklore would
            reflect the very essence of famiglia: loyalty, love, betrayal, and ultimate
            authority.</p>
        <p> Grimm’s Rapunzel tips its hat to Basile’s version. While it appears to draw inspiration
            from the idea that loyalty to family is paramount, it also highlights broader themes of
            independence and resilience. Grimm’s stories were often colorful depictions of the
            German countryside; it is well-known that the Germans valued nature and emphasized the
            importance of hearty country living. The setting of this story, in particular, utilizes
            the landscape to create a colorful background where there is freedom from a restrictive
            society; an irony considering the imprisonment of its main character. But, again, while
            Basile allows for a creative Rapunzel to chart her own path, the Grimm Bros. version
            requires the intervention of a man.</p>
        <h3>Beauty and the Beast</h3>
        <p> Beauty and the Beast is a story of metamorphosis. Folklore involving the transformation
            of a character from cursed figure into redeemed person is a cultural norm. One of the
            earliest versions of what would become known as Beauty and the Beast was noted as far
            back as the second century, when Apuleius penned a story of a Roman transformed into a
            donkey in the tale, The Golden Ass. It also was retold by Frenchwoman Jeanne-Marie
            Leprince de Beaumont in 1756. Her version of the story, La Belle et la Bête, followed a
            similar prescription: a man, cursed for some social error, is transformed, but
            ultimately redeemed in the end. Beaumont’s goal was to provide a moral lesson that all
            who enjoyed the story could not only understand, but incorporate into their daily lives.
            Focusing on the themes of moral virtue as opposed to vainglorious looks, Beaumont sought
            to transform the lives of her readers as much as the character was transformed in her
            story. </p>
        <p> It would seem as though the Grimm Bros. understood the powerful lesson shared by
            Beaumont. Their version of the story, The Singing, Springing Lark, also includes a kind,
            caring female protagonist. They don’t deviate, however, from the notion that women are
            to remain loyal and agreeable in the face of an unfair situation. Even though it may
            seem that the female character is the champion of the story, the brothers continued the
            story in order to incorporate additional help in order for the woman to overcome
            obstacles before being reunited with her true love. This is somewhat of an indictment of
            the social stereotypes being played out in fairy tales, as this story shows that even
            though the woman is the primary force of action, she cannot completely succeed on her
            own.</p>
