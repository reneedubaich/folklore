        <p>For our textual examinations, each group member chose to study one
            fairytale written by the German-born Grimm Brothers. These originally German fairytales were itirations
            of traditional tales, and included: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Red Riding Hood,
            Rapunzel, and Beauty and the Beast. Working with original translations, taken from the Gutenberg Files, we marked
            up the documents in individual XML files. The goal in said markup was to examine the
            characteristics typically attributed to women. We also wanted to examine how women were villainized, and how their autonomy
            differed from their male counterparts. Finally, we used our markup to focus on any
            mentions of female reproduction, to try and elicit themes of female inferiority on the basis of natural biological processes. After examining the Grimm Brothers' retellings of these classic tales, we then
            found translations written by other authors of varying languages. These tales included: Charles Perrault's French adaptation of Sleeping Beauty and
            Giambattista Basile's Italian retelling of Rapunzel. Examining our collection of German Grimm tales and non-German ones, we noted differences in female characterization. Thus,
            by using consistant markup across all of our XML files, we were able to
            examine the ways gendered langauge changed from culture-to-culture, and the implications
            that these changes suggested. </p>
