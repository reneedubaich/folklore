        <p>NOTE: each element has a myraid of attributes that correspond with them. "Gender" is the
            only attribute to appear across multiple elements. This is due to the significant role
            that gender and sexuality played in our research. </p>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>For our textual examinations, each group member chose to study one traditional folktale,
            including: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Beauty and the
            Beast. We each examined the origianl forms of these stories, working with original
            (often French) translations, taken from the Gutenberg Files, and adaptations written by
            the German-born Grimm Brothers. We marked up each of the documents in individual XML
            files. The goal in said markup was to examine the characteristics typically attributed
            to women: when they were villainized, how their autonomy differed from their male
            counterparts, where value was placed in their existence and how these stories provided a
            lens into society. We used our markup to highlight any mentions of female reproduction
            and domesticity to elicit themes of female inferiority on the basis of natural
            biological processes. By examining translations written by other authors of varying
            languages, we noted cultural differences in female characterization. Thus, by using
            consistent markup across all of our XML files, we were able to examine the ways gendered
            langauge changed from culture-to-culture, and the implications that these changes
            suggested. </p>
