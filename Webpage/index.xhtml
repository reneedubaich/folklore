        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our project! Through our digital research, we examined the representation of
            women via culture and language. Using folklore and commonly known fairytales, we were
            able to determine the valuation of female characteristics and understand in a broader
            societal lens.</p>
        <h2>
            <b>Background</b></h2>
        <p>The gender roles of women have been predominantly enforced as submissive to their male
            counterparts. This arises in real-world structures and, similarily, in the art that is
            produced-- specifically, through literature. Whether explicitly or implicitly, the
            characterizations of women are meant to show female readers how they're "supposed" to
            behave. This is done through the innocence and purification of young, beautiful
            antagonists, while simultaneously villainizing older, more "rigid" women (who happen to
            be past the age of child-bearing). Folktales are a great source to examine how these
            stereotypical norms are presented to readers, as they are well-known stories that arise
            in a range of cultures.</p>
