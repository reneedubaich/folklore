        <h2> <b>Background</b></h2>
        <p>The gender roles of women have been predominantly enforced as
            submissive to their male counterparts. This arises in real-world structures and,
            similarily, in the art that is produced-- specifically, through literature. Whether
            explicitly or implicitly, the characterizations of women are meant to show female
            readers how they're "supposed" to behave. This is done through the innocence and
            purification of young, beautiful antagonists, while simultaneously villainizing older,
            more "rigid" women (who happen to be past the age of child-bearing). Folktales are a
            great source to examine how these stereotypical norms are presented to readers, as they
            are well-known stories that arise in a range of cultures.</p>
        <h2> <b> Research Questions </b> </h2>
        <p>Our group's goal is to analyze the ways women are shown to behave and the implications
            this has on real-world readers. We ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do cultural translations of folktales act as a lens on female roles in their
                respective societies?</li>
            <li>Are women depicted as autonomous or subdued? What is their societal role?</li>
            <li>What are the different female stereotypes that are represented? Does this vary by
                age?</li>
            <li>What role do men in folktales play?</li>
            <li>How are relationships between women represented?</li>
            <li>What role do maternal and paternal figures play in these stories?</li>
        </ul>
