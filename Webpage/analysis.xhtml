        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Our goal with this project was to inspect the representation of women across time and culture. By looking at different translations of classic tales, 
        we were able to research the focal point of female identity within different societies. This aligns with historical expectations of female identity: docile, submissive women
        whose value is placed on their beauty and ability to be a mother. By decoding the specific language used, we were able to quanitfy the emphasis placed on certain female qualities,
        using this as a measure of what female characteristics were most important. We found that the female identity is often a contradictory one: while you are innocent, young and lovable,
        once you are past the ripeness of your youth, women are often villainized and secluded, either as a helpless elderly woman or an intimidating, controlling witch. </p>
