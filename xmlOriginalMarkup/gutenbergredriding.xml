    <!-- no author? says written by Charles Perrault (but I have his story), so more importantly translated by R.S. Gent, I'm guessing -->

    <p>Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a <adjective>little country</adjective>
        girl, <characteristic char_type="physical" depiction="beauty">the <adjective>prettiest
                creature</adjective> that ever was seen</characteristic>. <characteristic
            depiction="maternal">Her mother was very fond of her, and her grandmother loved her
            still more</characteristic>. This <adjective>good woman</adjective> made for her a
            <adjective>little</adjective> red riding-hood, which <reproduction rep_type="menstruation"
            >became the girl so well</reproduction> that everybody called her
            <adjective>Little</adjective> Red Riding-hood. </p>
    <p>One day her mother, <characteristic depiction="domesticity">having made some
            custards</characteristic>, said to her:— </p>
    <p>
        <quote>Go, my dear, and <autonomy auto_type="controlled"
                ><!-- dependent on others (grandma), red riding told by mother -->see how your

                    custard and this little pot of butter</characteristic></autonomy>.</quote>
    </p>
    <p><adjective>Little</adjective> Red Riding-hood <characteristic depiction="protective">set out

            grandmother's, who lived in another village</characteristic>. </p>
    <p>As she was going through the wood, she met Gaffer
        Wolf<!--actually name the wolf? weird and different-->, who had <characteristic
            depiction="clever" gender="male">a very great mind to eat her up; but he dared not,
            because of some fagot-makers hard by in the forest</characteristic>. He asked her
        whither she was going. <characteristic depiction="naivity">The <adjective>poor
                child</adjective>, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear a wolf
            talk,</characteristic> said to him:— </p>
    <p>
        <characteristic depiction="domesticity">
            <quote>I am going to see my grandmother, and carry her a custard and a little pot of
                butter from my mamma.</quote>
        </characteristic>
    </p>
    <p><quote>Does she live far off?</quote> said the Wolf. </p>
    <p><quote>Oh, yes,</quote> answered <adjective>Little</adjective> Red Riding-hood; <quote><characteristic
                depiction="naivity">it is beyond that mill you see there, the first house you come
                to in the village.</characteristic></quote>
    </p>
    <p><quote>Well,</quote> said the Wolf, <quote>and I'll go and see her, too. I'll go this way,
            and you go that, and we shall see who will be there first.</quote>

    <p><villainization cause="manipulation" gender="male">The Wolf <characteristic depiction="clever" gender="male">began to run as fast as he could,

            <adjective>little girl</adjective> went by the longest way, <characteristic depiction="domesticity">amusing herself by gathering nuts, running after
            butterflies, and making nosegays of such little flowers</characteristic> as she met
            with</characteristic>. The Wolf was not long before he reached the old woman's house.
        He knocked at the door—tap, tap, tap. </p>
    <p><quote>Who's there?</quote> called the grandmother. </p>
    <p><villainization cause="manipulation" gender="male"><quote>Your grandchild, <adjective>Little</adjective> Red

            mamma.</quote>
    </p>
    <p>The <adjective>good grandmother</adjective>, <characteristic char_type="physical">who was in
            bed</characteristic>, because she was somewhat ill, cried out:— </p>
    <p>
        <quote>Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.</quote>
    </p>
    <p>The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened. <characteristic char_type="physical"
            gender="male">He fell upon the <adjective>good woman</adjective> and ate her up in no time</characteristic>,
        for he had not eaten anything for more than three days. He then shut the door, went into the
        grandmother's bed, and waited for Little Red Riding-hood, who came sometime afterward and
        knocked at the door—tap, tap, tap. </p>
    <p><quote>Who's there?</quote> called the Wolf. </p>
    <p><adjective>Little</adjective> Red Riding-hood, hearing the <adjective>big voice</adjective> of the Wolf,
            <characteristic depiction="naivity">was at first afraid; but thinking her grandmother
            had a cold</characteristic>, answered:— </p>

    <p>The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice a little:— </p>

        <quote>Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.</quote>
    </p>
    <p><characteristic>Little</characteristic> Red Riding-hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened. </p>
    <p>The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes:— </p>

        <p>Little Red Riding-hood <autonomy auto_type="free">undressed herself</autonomy> and went
            into bed, where she was much surprised to see how her grandmother looked in her
