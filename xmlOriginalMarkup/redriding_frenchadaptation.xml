    <title>Little Red Riding Hood</title>

    <author>Charles Perrault</author>

    <p>Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a <adjective>little country</adjective>
        girl, <characteristic depiction="beauty">the <adjective>prettiest</adjective> creature who
            was ever seen</characteristic>. <characteristic depiction="maternal">Her mother was
                <adjective>excessively fond</adjective> of her; and her grandmother doted on her
            still more</characteristic><!-- motherhood being depicted as loving -->. <reproduction
            rep_type="menstruation">This <adjective>good woman</adjective> had a little red riding hood
                <autonomy auto_type="controlled">made for
            her</autonomy><!-- more so submissive, but nonetheless suggests inevitability of menstruation -->.
            It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding
            Hood.</reproduction> One day her mother, <characteristic depiction="domesticity">having
            made some cakes</characteristic>, said to her, <quote><characteristic age="old"><autonomy
                    auto_type="controlled">Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I
                    hear she has been very ill</autonomy></characteristic>. <characteristic
                depiction="domesticity">Take her a cake, and this little pot of
                butter</characteristic>.</quote></p>

    <p><characteristic depiction="innocent">Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her
            grandmother</characteristic><!-- eager to help -->, who <characteristic age="old"
            depiction="secluded">lived in another village.</characteristic></p>

    <p>As she was going through the wood, <autonomy auto_type="free">she met with a wolf</autonomy>
        <!-- the language here, that she "met with" a wolf almost makes her autonomous, suggesting that she did it on her own rather than him approaching her -->,
            <villainization gender="male" cause="manipulation">who had a very great mind to eat her
            up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the
            forest</villainization><!-- arguably him wanting to take advantage of her but not doing so b/c of bystanders, sex reading? -->.
        He asked her where she was going. The <adjective>poor child</adjective>, <characteristic
            depiction="innocent">who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a
            wolf</characteristic>, said to him, <quote>I am going to see my grandmother and carry
            her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.</quote></p>

    <p><quote>Does she live far off?</quote> said the wolf</p>

    <p><quote>Oh I say,</quote> answered <adjective>Little</adjective> Red Riding Hood; <quote><characteristic
                depiction="naivity">it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the
                village</characteristic>.</quote></p>

    <p><quote>Well,</quote> said the wolf, <quote>and I'll go and see her too. <villainization
                cause="manipulation"><autonomy auto_type="free">I'll go this way and go you that,
                    and we shall see who will be there
        first</autonomy></villainization>.</quote></p>
    <!-- an interesting difference here, the wolf isn't as explicitly manipulating her (but implicitly). wonder what this could say? -->

    <p><characteristic depiction="clever" gender="male">The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the
            shortest path</characteristic>, and the <adjective>little girl</adjective> took a roundabout way,
            <characteristic depiction="innocent">entertaining herself by <characteristic
                depiction="domesticity">gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering
                bouquets of little
            flowers</characteristic><!-- all she can run after are household items? (food, decor, beauty, etc.) --></characteristic>.
        It was not long before the wolf arrived at the <adjective>old woman</adjective>'s house. He knocked at the door:
        tap, tap.</p>

    <p>
        <quote>Who's there?</quote>
    </p>

    <p><quote>Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,</quote> replied the wolf, <villainization
            cause="manipulation">counterfeiting her voice</villainization>; <quote>who has brought
            you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother.</quote></p>

    <p>The <adjective>good grandmother</adjective>, <autonomy auto_type="controlled">who was in
            bed, because she was somewhat ill</autonomy><!-- dependency -->, cried out, <quote>Pull the bobbin,
            and the latch will go up.</quote></p>

    <p>The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then <autonomy auto_type="controlled">he
            immediately fell upon the good
        woman<!-- the language, that he 'fell' on the grandma, isn't an action for him, but rather something that happens to him (almost submissively)... interesting -->
        and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days
            since he had eaten</autonomy>. He then <villainization cause="manipulation">shut the
            door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding
            Hood</villainization>, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap,
        tap.</p>

    <p>
        <quote>Who's there?</quote>
    </p>

    <p>Little Red Riding Hood, <characteristic depiction="innocent">hearing the <adjective>big</adjective> voice of the
            wolf, was at first afraid; but <characteristic depiction="naivity">believing her
                grandmother had a cold and was hoarse</characteristic><!-- woman as trusting --></characteristic>, answered,
            <quote>It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a
            little pot of butter mother sends you.</quote></p>

    <p>The wolf cried out to her, <villainization cause="manipulation" gender="male">softening his voice as much as he could</villainization>, <quote>Pull the bobbin,
            and the latch will go up.</quote></p>

    <p>Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.</p>

    <p>The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, <quote>Put
            the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and <villainization cause="sex"
                >come get into bed with me</villainization>.</quote></p>

    <p>
        <reproduction rep_type="sex"><autonomy auto_type="free">Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into
                bed</autonomy>. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her
            nightclothes, and said to her, <quote>Grandmother, what big arms you have!</quote></reproduction>
        <!-- SEX!!! -->
    </p>
   

    <p><characteristic depiction="naivity"> <villainization cause="manipulation"><quote>All the better to hug you with, my dear.</quote>

    <quote>Grandmother, what big legs you have!</quote>

    <quote>All the better to run with, my child.</quote>

    <quote>Grandmother, what big ears you have!</quote>

    <quote>All the better to hear with, my child.</quote>

    <quote>Grandmother, what big eyes you have!</quote>

    <quote>All the better to see with, my child.</quote>

    <quote>Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!</quote>

    <quote>
        <villainization gender="male" cause="sex">All the better to eat you up
            with.</villainization>
    </quote></villainization></characteristic></p>

    <p>And, saying these words, <autonomy auto_type="controlled">this <adjective>wicked</adjective> wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all
        up</autonomy>.</p>
    <!-- interesting that it ends here and that there is no male savior in this version, warning against sex -->
    <p>Moral: Children, <characteristic depiction="beauty">especially
                <adjective>attractive</adjective>, <adjective>well bred young</adjective>
            ladies</characteristic>, should never talk to strangers, for if they should do so, they
        may well provide dinner for a wolf. <villainization gender="male" cause="sex">I say
                <quote>wolf,</quote> but there are various kinds of wolves.</villainization> There
        are also those who are <adjective gender="male"> charming, quiet, polite, unassuming,
            complacent, and sweet,</adjective> who pursue young women at home and in the streets.
        And <villainization gender="male">unfortunately, it is these <adjective>gentle</adjective> wolves who are the most
            dangerous ones of all</villainization>.</p>
