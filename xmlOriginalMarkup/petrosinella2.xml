    <title>Parsley [Petrosinella]</title>
<p>There was once upon a time a woman named Pascadozzia. As she was standing one day at a window, which looked into the garden of an ogress,
<characteristic depiction="beauty">she saw a <adjective>beautiful</adjective> bed of parsley, for which she took such a longing that she was on the point of fainting away</characteristic>; 
and being unable to resist her desire, she watched until the ogress went out, and then plucked a handful of it.</p>

<p>But when the ogress came home, and was going to cook her pottage, she found that some one had been at the parsley, and said, 
<quote>"Ill luck to me but I'll catch this <adjective>long-fingered</adjective> rogue, <villianization cause="revenge">and make him repent it, and teach him to his cost that every one should eat off his 
own platter, and not meddle with other folks' cups.</villianization>"</quote></p>

<p>The <adjective>poor</adjective> woman went again and again down into the garden, until one morning the ogress met her, and in a <characteristic depiction="emotional">furious rage</characteristic> exclaimed, 
<quote><characteristic depiction="emotional">"Have I caught you at last, you thief, you rogue? Prithee do you pay the rent of the garden, that you come in this impudent way and steal
my plants? <villanization cause="revenge">By my faith, but I'll make you do penance!"</villanization></characteristic></quote></p>

<p><adjective>Poor</adjective> Pascadozzia, in a terrible fright, began to make excuses, saying that neither from gluttony nor the craving of hunger had <autonomy level="religious">she been tempted
by the devil</autonomy> to commit this fault, but fear <characteristic depiction="maternal">she had lest the child should be born with a crop of parsley on its face</characteristic>; and she added that the 
ogress ought rather to thank her, for not having given her sore eyes. <quote>"Words are but wind,"</quote> answered the ogress; <quote>"I am not to be
caught with such prattle; you have closed the balance sheet of life,<villanization cause="revenge"><characteristic depiction="maternal"> unless you promise to
give me the child you bring forth, girl or boy, whichever it may be.</characteristic></villanization>"</quote></p>

<p><characteristic depiction="innocent">Poor Pascadozzia</characteristic>, in order to escape the peril in which she found herself, swore with one hand upon another to keep the promise. So the ogress let her go free. 
But when her time was come, <reproduction rep_type="childbirth">Pascadozzia gave birth to a little girl</reproduction>, <characteristic depiction="beauty">so beautiful that she was a joy to look upon</characteristic>, who, from having a fine sprig 
of parsley on her bosom, was named Parsley. And the little girl grew from day to day, until when <characteristic age="young">she was seven years old</characteristic> her mother sent her to school; 
and every time she went along the street and met the ogress, <characteristic age="old">the old woman</characteristic> said to her, <quote>"Tell your mother to remember her promise."</quote></p>

<p>And she went on repeating this message so often, that the <adjective>poor</adjective> mother, having no longer patience to listen to the same tale, said one day to 
Parsley, <quote>"If you meet the <characteristic age="old">old woman</characteristic> as usual, and she reminds you of the <adjective>hateful</adjective> promise, answer her, 'Take it!'"</quote>When Parsley,<characteristic depiction="naivity"> who dreamt of no ill,</characteristic> 
met the ogress again, and heard her repeat the same words, <characteristic depiction="naivity">she answered <adjective>innocently</adjective> as her mother had told her</characteristic>;
whereupon the ogress, <autonomy auto_type="controlled">seizing her by her hair</autonomy>, <autonomy auto_type="controlled">carried her off to a wood, which the sun never entered. Then she put the poor girl into a tower, 
which she caused to arise by her art, and which had neither gate nor ladder, but only a little window, through which she ascended and descended by 
means of Parsley's hair</autonomy>, which was very long, as the sailor is used to run up and down the mast of a ship.</p>

<p>Now it happened one day, when the ogress had left the tower, <autonomy level="damsel">that Parsley put her head out of the little window, and let loose her tresses 
in the sun</autonomy>; and the son of <autonomy level="male_savior">a prince passing by saw these two golden banners, which invited all souls to enlist under the standard of love</autonomy>;
and beholding with amazement in the midst of those <characteristic depiction="beauty">gleaming waves a siren's face, that enchanted all hearts, he fell desperately in love with such
wonderful beauty</characteristic>; and sending her a memorial of sighs, she decreed to receive him into favor.</p>

<p>Matters went on so well with the prince, that there was soon a nodding of heads and kissing of hands, thanks and offerings, hopes and promises, soft 
words and compliments. And when this had continued for several days, Parsley and the prince became so intimate that they made an appointment to meet,
and agreed that it should be at night, and that <characteristic depiction="clever">Parsley should give the ogress some poppy juice</characteristic>, and draw up the prince with her tresses. So when the
appointed hour came, the prince went to the tower, where Parsley, letting fall her hair at a given signal, he seized it with both his hands, and cried, 
<quote>"Draw up!"</quote> And when he was drawn up, he crept through the little window into the chamber.</p>

<p>The next morning early, the prince descended by the same golden ladder, to go his way home. And having repeated these visits many times, a gossip of the
ogress, who was for ever prying into things that did not concern her, and poking her nose into every corner, got to find out the secret, and told the 
ogress to be upon the lookout, for that Parsley was courted by <characteristic age="young">a youth</characteristic>.</p>

<p>The ogress thanked the gossip for the information, and said she would take good care to stop up the road; and as to Parsley, <autonomy auto_type="controlled">it was impossible for her to 
escape, as she had laid a spell upon her</autonomy>, so that, unless she had in her hand the three gallnuts which were in a rafter in the kitchen, 
it would be labor lost to attempt to get away.</p>

<p>Whilst they were talking thus together, Parsley, who stood with her ears wide open, and had some suspicion of the gossip, overheard all 
that passed. And when night had spread out her black garments, and the prince had come as usual, <characteristic depiction="clever">she made him climb onto the rafters and 
find the gallnuts, knowing well what effect they would have, as she had been enchanted by the ogress</characteristic>. Then, having made a rope ladder, 
<autonomy auto_type="free">they both descended to the ground, took to their heels, and scampered off towards the city</autonomy>.</p>

<p>But the gossip happening to see them come out, set up a loud halloo, and began to shout and make such a noise that the ogress awoke; and seeing
that Parsley had fled, she descended by the same ladder, which was fastened to the window, and set off running after the lovers, who, when 
they saw her coming at their heels faster than a horse let loose, gave themselves up for lost. <autonomy level="heroin">But Parsley, recollecting the gallnuts, quickly 
threw one on the ground</autonomy>, and lo! instantly a Corsican bulldog started up, -- a terrible beast! -- which with open jaws and barking loud flew
at the ogress as if to swallow her at a mouthful. But the <characteristic age="old">old woman</characteristic>, who was <autonomy level="religious">more <adjective>cunning</adjective> and <adjective>spiteful</adjective> than the devil</autonomy>, <!-- idk if these would count as adjectives, but nice to note-->
<characteristic depiction="clever">put her hand into her
pocket, and pulling out a piece of bread, gave it to the dog, which made him hang his tail and allay his fury.</characteristic></p>

<p>Then she turned to run after the fugitives again; <autonomy level="heroin">but Parsley, seeing her approach, threw the second gallnut on the ground</autonomy>, and lo! a fierce 
lion arose, who, lashing the earth with his tail, and shaking his mane, and opening wide his jaws a yard apart, was just preparing to make a 
slaughter of the ogress; <characteristic depiction="clever">when, turning quickly back, she stripped the skin off an ass that was grazing in the middle of a meadow, and ran at 
the lion</characteristic>, who, fancying it a real jackass, was so frightened that he bounded away as fast as he could.</p>

<p>The ogress, having leaped over this second ditch, turned again to pursue the <adjectives>poor</adjectives> lovers, who, hearing the clatter of her heels and seeing the
cloud of dust that rose up to the sky, conjectured that she was coming again. But the <characteristic age="old">old woman</characteristic>, who was every moment in dread lest the lion
should pursue her, had not taken off the ass's skin; <autonomy level="heroin">and when Parsley now threw down the third gallnut</autonomy>, there sprang up a wolf, who, without
giving the ogress time to play any new trick, gobbled her up just as she was, in the shape of a jackass.</p>
    
<p><autonomy auto_type="free">So the lovers, being now freed from danger</autonomy>, went their way leisurely and quietly to the kingdom of the prince, where, with his father's
free consent, he took Parsley to wife; and thus, after all these storms of fate, they experienced the truth, that

One hour in port, the sailor freed from fears
Forgets the tempests of a hundred years.

Zeza's story was listened to with such delight to the end, that, had it even continued for an hour longer, the time would have appeared only a moment.</p>
