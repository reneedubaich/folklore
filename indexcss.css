/*Are you guys good with this as the colors and fonts for the general info pages?
 * this is the color pallate I used, I just made some adjustments so it presented better on the page: https://coolors.co/palette/f0ead2-dde5b6-adc178-a98467-6c584c
 * I was thinking then we can use different colors and fonts for each individual piece of lit's page */
