    <title>LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.</title>
    <!-- no author? says written by Charles Perrault (but I have his story), so more importantly translated by R.S. Gent, I'm guessing -->

    <p>Once upon a time there lived in a certain village <adjective>a little country</adjective> girl, <characteristic char_type="physical" depiction="beauty">the <adjective>prettiest
        creature</adjective> that ever was seen</characteristic>. <characteristic depiction="maternal">Her mother was very fond of her, and her grandmother loved her
        still more</characteristic>. This good woman made for her a little red riding-hood, which <menstruation motif="colorred">became the girl so
        well</menstruation> that everybody called her Little Red Riding-hood. </p>
    <p>One day her mother, <characteristic depiction="domesticity">having made some custards</characteristic>, said to her:— </p>
    <p><quote>Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother does, for <characteristic age="old">I hear she has been very ill</characteristic>; carry her
        a custard and this little pot of butter.</quote></p>
    <p>Little Red Riding-hood <characteristic depiction="obedient">set out immediately</characteristic> to <characteristic depiction="secluded" age="old">go to her grandmother's, who lived in another
        village</characteristic>. </p>
    <p>As she was going through the wood, she met Gaffer Wolf<!--actually name the wolf? weird and different-->, who had <characteristic depiction="clever" gender="male">a very great mind to eat her
        up; but he dared not, because of some fagot-makers hard by in the forest</characteristic>. He asked her
        whither she was going. <characteristic depiction="naivity">The <adjective>poor child</adjective>, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and
        hear a wolf talk,</characteristic> said to him:— </p>
    <p><charaacteristic depiction="domesticity"><quote>I am going to see my grandmother, and carry her a custard and a little pot of butter
        from my mamma.</quote></charaacteristic></p>
    <p><quote>Does she live far off?</quote> said the Wolf. </p>
    <p><quote>Oh, yes,</quote> answered Little Red Riding-hood; <quote><characteristic depiction="naivity">it is beyond that mill you see there, the first
        house you come to in the village.</characteristic></quote> </p>
    <p><quote>Well,</quote> said the Wolf, <quote>and I'll go and see her, too. I'll go this way, and you go that, and
        we shall see who will be there first.</quote> </p>
    <p><villainization cause="manipulation" gender="male">The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the shortest way</villainization>, and <characterization depiction="innocent">the little girl went
        by the longest way, amusing herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making
        nosegays of such little flowers as she met with</characterization>. The Wolf was not long before he reached the
        old woman's house. He knocked at the door—tap, tap, tap. </p>
    <p><quote>Who's there?</quote> called the grandmother. </p>
    <p><villainization cause="manipulation" gender="male"><quote>Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-hood,</quote> replied the Wolf, imitating her voice</villainization>, <quote>who has
        brought a custard and a little pot of butter sent to you by mamma.</quote> </p>
    <p>The <adjective>good grandmother</adjective>, <charactistic char_type="physical">who was in bed</charactistic>, because she was somewhat ill, cried out:— </p>
    <p><quote>Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.</quote> </p>
    <p>The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened. <characteristic char_type="phyiscal" gender="male">He fell upon the good woman and ate her up
        in no time</characteristic>, for he had not eaten anything for more than three days. He then shut the door, went into the grandmother's bed, and waited for Little Red Riding-hood, who came
        sometime afterward and knocked at the door—tap, tap, tap. </p>
    <p><quote>Who's there?</quote> called the Wolf. </p>
    <p>Little Red Riding-hood, hearing <adjective>the big voice of the Wolf</adjective>, <characteristic depiction="naivity">was at first afraid; but thinking
        her grandmother had a cold</characteristic>, answered:— </p>
    <p><quote>'Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-hood, who has brought you a custard and a little pot
        of butter sent to you by mamma.</quote> </p>
    <p>The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice a little:— </p>
    <p><quote>Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up.</quote> </p>
    <p>Little Red Riding-hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened. </p>
    <p>The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes:— </p>
   <villainization cause="sex"> <p><quote>Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come and lie down with me.</quote> </p>
    <p>Little Red Riding-hood <autonomy auto_type="free">undressed herself</autonomy> and went into bed, where she was much surprised to
        see how her grandmother looked in her night-clothes. </p></villainization>
    <p>She said to her:— </p>
    <p><quote>Grandmamma<!-- might be interesting to mark cultural differences as we find translations? use of grandmamma is def unique lol -->,
        what great arms you have got!</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>That is the better to hug thee, my dear.</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>That is to run the better, my child.</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>Grandmamma, what great ears you have got!</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>That is to hear the better, my child.</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>It is to see the better, my child.</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!</quote> </p>
    <p><quote>That is to eat thee up.</quote> </p>
    <p>And, saying these words, <characteristic char_type="physical" auto_type="controlled" gender="female">this wicked Wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-hood, and ate her all
        up.</characteristic> </p>
