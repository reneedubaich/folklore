    <title> Little Snow-white </title> 
    Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of
    snow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and <characteristic type = "physical" value = "trait"> the frame of
        the window was made of black ebony. </characteristic> And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at
    the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow.
    And the <characteristic type = "physical" value = "trait">red looked pretty upon the white snow </characteristic>, and she thought to herself, <quote> Would that I
        had a <characteristic type = "physical" value = "trait"> child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame </characteristic>.
    </quote> Soon after that <characteristic type = "physical" value = "trait"> she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as
        blood, and her hair was as black as ebony; and she was therefore called Little Snow-white.</characteristic> And
    when the child was born, the Queen died. After a year had passed the King took to himself
    another wife. <characterisitc type = "physical" "nonphysical" value = "beauty" "vain"> She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that
        anyone else should surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood
    in front of it and looked at herself in it, and said— <quote> Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on
        the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all? </quote> the looking-glass answered—
        <quote> Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all! </characteristc> </quote> Then she was satisfied, for she knew
        that the looking-glass spoke the truth.  <characterisitc type = "physical" value = "beauty">But Snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more
    beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful
    than the Queen herself.</characterisitc> <villanization cause = "competition" "jealousy"> And once when the Queen asked her looking-glass— <quote> Looking-glass,
        Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all? </quote> it answered—
        <quote> Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen. But more beautiful still is
        Snow-white, as I ween. </quote> Then the Queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with
    envy. From that hour, whenever she looked at Snow-white, her heart heaved in her breast, she
    hated the girl so much. And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so
    that she had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said, <quote> Take the child away
        into the forest; I will no longer have her in my sight. Kill her, and bring me back her
        heart as a token. </villanization></quote> The huntsman obeyed, and took her away; but when he had drawn his
    knife, and was <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "damsel"> about to pierce Snow-white’s innocent heart, she began to weep, and said,<quote>
        “Ah dear huntsman, leave me my life! I will run away into the wild forest, and never come
        home again.  </quote> <characteristic value = "beauty" type = "physical"> And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her </characteristic>and said,
        <quote> Run away, then, you poor child. </autonomy> The wild beasts will soon have devoured you,
    </quote> thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was
    no longer needful for him to kill her. And as <villanization cause = "competition" "jealousy" gender = "female"> a young boar just then came running by he stabbed
    it, and cut out its heart and took it to the Queen as proof that the child was dead. The cook
    had to salt this, and the wicked Queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the heart of
    Snow-white.</villanization> <autonomy type = "controlled" "damsel">  But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she
    looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not know what to do. Then she began to run, and ran
    over sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm. She
    ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening; then she saw a little cottage and
    went into it to rest herself. </autonomy> Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than
    can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates, and on each
    plate a little spoon; moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs.
    Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.
    Little Snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from each
    plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.
    Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of them
    suited her; one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was
    right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep. When it was quite dark the
    owners of the cottage came back; they were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for
    ore. They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within the cottage they saw that
    someone had been there, for everything was not in the same order in which they had left it. The
    first said, <quote> Who has been sitting on my chair? </quote> The second, <quote> Who has been
        eating off my plate? </quote> The third, <quote> Who has been taking some of my bread?
    </quote> The fourth, <quote> Who has been eating my vegetables? </quote> The fifth, <quote> Who
        has been using my fork? </quote> The sixth, <quote> Who has been cutting with my knife?
    </quote> The seventh, <quote> Who has been drinking out of my mug? </quote> Then the first
    looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his bed, and he said, <quote> Who has been
        getting into my bed? </quote> The others came up and each called out, <quote> Somebody has
        been lying in my bed too. </quote> But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little
    Snow-white, who was lying asleep therein. And he called the others, who came running up, and
    they cried out with astonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall
    on little Snow-white. <quote> Oh, heavens! oh, heavens! </quote> cried they, <quote> <characteristic value = "physical" type = "baauty"> what a
        lovely child! </characteristic> </quote> and they were so glad that they did not wake her up, but let her
    sleep on in the bed. And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so
    got through the night. When it was morning little Snow-white awoke, and was frightened when she
    saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly and asked her what her name was. <quote> My name is
        Snow-white, </quote> she answered. <quote> How have you come to our house? </quote> said the
    dwarfs. Then she told them that <villanization gender = "female"> her step-mother had wished to have her killed, </villanization> <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "damsel"> but that the
    huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run for the whole day, until at last she had
    found their dwelling.</autonomy> <autonomy type = "comtrolled" level = "male_savior"> The dwarfs said, <quote> If you will take care of our house, cook, make
        the beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and clean, you can stay
        with us and you shall want for nothing.</autonomy> </quote>
    <quote> Yes, </quote> said Snow-white, <quote>with all my heart,</quote> and she stayed with
    them. She kept the house in order for them; in the mornings they went to the mountains and
    looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came back, and then their supper had to be
    ready. The girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her and said, <quote> Beware
        of your step-mother, she will soon know that you are here; be sure to let no one come in.
    </quote> But the Queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-white’s heart, could not but think
    that she was again the first and most beautiful of all; and she went to her looking-glass and
    said— <quote> <characterisitc type = "physical" value = "beauty" "vain"> Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?</characterisitc>
    </quote> and the glass answered— <quote> Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the
        hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well, <characteristic type = "physical" value = "beauty"> And none is so fair
            as she.</characteristic> </quote> <villanization cause = "comeptition" "revenge" "jealousy" gender = "male" "female"> Then she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass never spoke
    falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, and that little Snow-white was still
    alive. And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so long as she was not
    the fairest in the whole land, envy let her have no rest. And when she had at last thought of
    something to do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old peddler-woman, and no one
    could have known her. In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs,
    and knocked at the door and cried, <quote> Pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap.
    </quote> Little Snow-white looked out of the window and called out, <quote> Good-day my good
        woman, what have you to sell? </quote>
    <quote> Good things, pretty things, </quote> she answered; <quote>stay-laces of all colours,
    </quote> and she pulled out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk. <quote> <characterisitc type = "nonphysical" value = "naive"> I may let the
        worthy old woman in, </quote> thought Snow-white, and she unbolted the door and bought the
                pretty laces. </characterisitc> <quote> Child, </quote> said the old woman, <quote> what a fright you look; come,
        I will lace you properly for once. </quote> Snow-white had no suspicion, but stood before
    her, and let herself be laced with the new laces. But the old woman laced so quickly and so
    tightly that Snow-white lost her breath and fell down as if dead. <quote> <characteristic value = "beauty" type = "physical">Now I am the most
        beautiful, </characteristic></quote> said the Queen to herself, and ran away. </villanization> Not long afterwards, in the
    evening, <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "damsel" "male_savior"> the seven dwarfs came home, but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little
    Snow-white lying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to be dead.
    They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces; then
    she began to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again. </autonomy> When the dwarfs heard what
    had happened they said, <quote> The old peddler-woman was no one else than <characteristic type = "nonphysical" value = "evil"> the wicked Queen;</characteristic>
        take care and let no one come in when we are not with you. </quote> <characterisitc type = "physical" "nonphysical" value = "beauty" "vain">But the wicked woman
    when she had reached home went in front of the glass and asked— <quote> Looking-glass,
        Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all?  </quote> and it answered
    as before— <quote> Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven
        dwarfs dwell, Snow-white is still alive and well, And none is so fair as she. </characteristic> </quote> <villanization cause = "comeptition" "revenge" "jealousy" gender = "female"> When
    she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she saw plainly that little
    Snow-white was again alive. <quote> But now, </quote> she said, <quote> I will think of
        something that shall put an end to you, </quote> and by the help of witchcraft, which she
    understood, she made a poisonous comb. Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another
    old woman. So she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door, and
    cried, <quote> Good things to sell, cheap, cheap! </quote> Little Snow-white looked out and
    said, <quote> Go away; I cannot let any one come in. </quote>
    <quote> “I suppose you can look, </quote> said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb out
    and held it up. It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled, and opened the
    door. When they had made a bargain the old woman said, <quote> Now I will comb you properly for
        once. </quote> Poor little Snow-white had no suspicion, and let the old woman do as she
    pleased, but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the
    girl fell down senseless. <quote> <characteristic value = "beauty" type = "physical">You paragon of beauty,</characteristic> </quote> said the wicked woman, <quote>
        you are done for now, </quote> and she went away. </villanization>But fortunately it was almost evening,
    when the seven dwarfs came home. <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "damsel" "male_savior"> When they saw Snow-white lying as if dead upon the ground they
    at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked and found the poisoned comb. Scarcely had
    they taken it out when Snow-white came to herself, and told them what had happened. </autonomy>Then they
            warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one. <characterisitc type = "physical" "nonphysical" value = "beauty" "vain">The Queen, at home,
    went in front of the glass and said— <quote> Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in
        this land is the fairest of all? </quote> then it answered as before— <quote> “Oh, Queen,
        thou art fairest of all I see, But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell, Snow-white
        is still alive and well, And none is so fair as she. </characteristic></quote> <<villanization cause = "comeptition" "revenge" "jealousy" gender = "female"> When she heard the glass speak
    thus she trembled and shook with rage. <quote> Snow-white shall die, </quote> she cried, <quote>
        even if it costs me my life! </quote> Thereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room,
    where no one ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty,
    white with a red cheek, so that everyone who saw it longed for it; but whoever ate a piece of it
    must surely die. When the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself up as a
    country-woman, and so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs. She knocked at the
    door. </villanization>Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, <quote> I cannot let any one in; the
        seven dwarfs have forbidden me. </quote>
    <quote> It is all the same to me, </quote> answered the woman, <quote> I shall soon get rid of
        my apples. There, I will give you one. </quote>
    <quote> No, </quote> said Snow-white, <quote> I dare not take anything. </quote>
    <quote> Are you afraid of poison? </quote> said the old woman; <quote> look, I will cut the
        apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white. </quote> The apple was
    so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-white longed for the fine apple,
    and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and stretched out her
    hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "damsel"> she fell down
    dead. Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said, <quote>
        <characteristic type = "physical" value = "beauty"> White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood!</characteristic> this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up
        again. </quote></autonomy> <characterisitc type = "physical" "nonphysical" value = "beauty" "vain"> And when she asked of the Looking-glass at home— <quote> Looking-glass,
        Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the fairest of all? </quote> it answered at
    last— <quote> Oh, Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all. </quote> Then her envious heart
    had rest, so far as an envious heart can have rest. </characterisitc> The dwarfs, when they came home in the
    evening, found Snow-white lying upon the ground; she breathed no longer and was dead. They
    lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her
    hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use; the poor child was dead, and
    remained dead. They laid her upon a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her,
    and wept three days long. <chracteristic value = "beauty" type = "physical">  Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were
    living, and still had her pretty red cheeks. </chracteristiccal>They said, <quote> We could not bury her in the
        dark ground, </quote> and they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be
    seen from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and
    that she was a king’s daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them
    always stayed by it and watched it. And birds came too, and wept for Snow-white; first an owl,
    then a raven, and last a dove. And now Snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and <chracteristic value = "beauty" type = "physical">she
    did not change, but looked as if she were asleep; for she was as white as snow, as red as blood,
    and her hair was as black as ebony. </chracteristic> It happened, however, that a king’s son came into the
    forest, and went to the dwarfs’ house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and
        <chracteristic value = "beauty" type = "physical"> <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "damsel"> the beautiful Snow-white </chracteristic>within it, </autonomy>and read what was written upon it in golden letters. Then he
    said to the dwarfs, <quote> Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.
    </quote> But the dwarfs answered, <quote> We will not part with it for all the gold in the
        world. </quote> Then he said, <quote> <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "damsel" "male_savior"> Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without
        seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her as my dearest possession. </quote> As he
        spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin. And now the
    King’s son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they
    stumbled over a tree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had
    bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the
    coffin, sat up, and was once more alive. <quote> Oh, heavens, where am I? </quote> she cried.
    The King’s son, full of joy, said, <quote> You are with me, </quote> and told her what had
    happened, and said, <quote> I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my
        father’s palace, you shall be my wife. </quote> </autonomy> And Snow-white was willing, and went with
    him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour. But Snow-white’s <chracteristic value = "evil" type = "nonphysical"> wicked
        step-mother </chracteristic> was also bidden to the feast. <characterisitc type = "physical" "nonphysical" value = "beauty" "vain"> When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she
    went before the Looking-glass, and said— <quote> Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who
        in this land is the fairest of all? </quote> the glass answered— <quote> Oh, Queen, of all
            here the fairest art thou, But the young Queen is fairer by far as I trow. </quote> </characterisitc> <villanization cause = "competition" "jealousy" "revenge" gender = "female">Then the
    wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly wretched, that she knew not what
    to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see
    the young Queen. And when she went in she knew Snow-white; and she stood still with rage and
    fear, and could not stir.  </villanization> But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire, and they were
    brought in with tongs, and set before her. Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and
    dance until she dropped down dead. </story>
