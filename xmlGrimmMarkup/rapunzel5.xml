    <title>Rapunzel</title>
    <p> There were once a man and a woman who <characteristic char_type="maternal">wished for a
        child</characteristic>.
        At length the woman hoped <autonomy auto_type="religious">that God was
            about to grant her desire</autonomy>.  These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden
        could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however,
        surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an
        enchantress , <autonomy auto_type="evil">who had great power</autonomy> and was
        <villianization cause="power">dreaded by all the world</villianization>. One day the woman was standing by this
        window and looking down into the garden, when <characteristic depiction="beauty">she saw a bed which was planted with the most
            beautiful rampion - rapunzel , and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for
            it</characteristic>, and had the greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day,
        and as she knew that she could not get any of it, <characteristic depiction="weak">she quite pined away, and began to look
            pale and miserable</characteristic>.Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, <quote>"what ails you, dear wife."</quote>
        <quote>"Ah, she replied, if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind
            our house, I shall die."</quote> The <characteristic char_type="man"
                >man</characteristic>, who loved her thought, <autonomy level="male_savior">sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost
                    what it will</autonomy>. At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the
        garden of the enchantress ,<autonomy level="male_savior"> hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife</autonomy>. 
        She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it <adjective>greedily</adjective>.
        It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as
        much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself
        down again. But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the
        enchantress standing before him.<quote><villanization cause="revenge">"How can you dare, said she with angry look,
            descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief. You shall suffer for
            it."</villanization></quote> Ah, answered he, "let mercy take the place of justice,
        I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife
        saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if
        she had not got some to eat." Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and
        said to him,<quote>
            <villianization cause="revenge">"if the case be as you say, I will allow you to take
                away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give
                me the child which your wife will bring into the world. <characteristic
                    char_type="maternal"> It shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a
                    mother.</characteristic>"</villianization></quote>
        The <autonomy gender="man">man</autonomy> in his terror consented to
        everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at
        once, gave the child the name of rapunzel , <villianization cause="revenge">and took it away with
            her</villianization>.Rapunzel grew into <characteristic depiction="beauty">the most
                beautiful child under the sun</characteristic>. When <characteristic age="young">she was
                    twelve years old</characteristic>, the enchantress <autonomy auto_type="controlled"><characteristic depiction="secluded">shut
                        her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor
                        door, but quite at the top was a little window.</characteristic></autonomy> When the enchantress wanted
        to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried, <quote>" rapunzel , rapunzel , let down
            your hair to me."</quote> Rapunzel had
        <characteristic char_type="physical">magnificent long hair, fine as spun
            gold,</characteristic> and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened
        <characteristic char_type="physical">her braided tresses, wound them round one of the
            hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down</characteristic>, and
        the enchantress climbed up by it.</p>
    <p>After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode through the forest and passed
        by the tower.Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was rapunzel , who in
        her solitude passed her time in<characteristic char_type="innocence"> letting <characteristic depiction="beauty">her sweet
            voice</characteristic> resound</characteristic> The king's son wanted to
        climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be
        found.
        He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went
        out into the forest and listened to it.Once when he was thus standing
        behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried, <quote>"
            rapunzel , rapunzel , let down your hair."</quote></p>
    <p>Then rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. If that
        is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune, said he, and the next day when
        it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried, <quote>" rapunzel , rapunzel , let
            down your hair."</quote></p> Immediately the hair fell
    down and the king's son climbed up. <p>At first rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man,
        such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her. But the king's son began to
        talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it
        had let him have no rest, and he<characteristic depiction="beauty"> had been forced to see
            her</characteristic>. Then rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her
        if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was <characteristic
            age="young">young</characteristic> and
        <characteristic depiction="beauty">handsome</characteristic>, she thought, he will
        love me more than <characteristic age="old">old</characteristic> dame gothel
        does. And she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said, <quote>"I will willingly go
            away with you, <autonomy auto_type="free">
                but I do not know how to get down.</autonomy>" </quote>
        <quote>"Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder
            with it, and when <characteristic depiction="domesticity">that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your
                horse</characteristic>."</quote> They agreed that until that time he should come to
        her every evening, for the old <characteristic age="old"
            >woman</characteristic>
        came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once rapunzel said to her,
        <quote>"tell me, dame gothel , how it happens that <characteristic char_type="physical"
            >you are so much heavier</characteristic> for me to draw up than the young king's
            son - he is with me in a moment."</quote>
        <quote>"Ah. You wicked child,"</quote> cried the enchantress . <quote>"What do I hear you
            say. <villianization cause="revenge">I thought <autonomy auto_type="controlled">I had separated you from all the
                world</autonomy>, and yet you have deceived me.</villianization>"</quote> In her anger she clutched
        rapunzel 's <characteristic char_type="physical">beautiful tresses,</characteristic>
        <autonomy auto_type="evil">wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors
            with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the <adjective>lovely</adjective>
            braids lay on the ground.</autonomy>
        <autonomy auto_type="damsel"> And she was so pitiless that <characteristic depiction="secluded">she took poor rapunzel into a
            desert where she had to live in great grief and misery</characteristic></autonomy>.</p>
    <p>On the same day that she cast out rapunzel ,however, the enchantress fastened the
        braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the
        window, and when the king's son came and cried,
        <quote> "rapunzel , rapunzel , let down your hair,she let the hair down."</quote></p>
    <p>The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest rapunzel , he found the
        enchantress , <characteristic auto_type="physical">who gazed at him with wicked and venomous
            looks</characteristic>. <quote>"Aha"</quote>, <autonomy auto_type="evil">she cried
                mockingly</autonomy>, <quote>"you would fetch your dearest, but the
                    <adjective>beautiful</adjective> bird sits no longer singing in the nest.The cat has
                    got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. <autonomy auto_type="controlled">Rapunzel is
                        lost to you. You will never see her again."</autonomy></quote>
        The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the
        tower.<characteristic char_type="physical"> He escaped with his life,
            but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes</characteristic>.         
        Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and
        did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his <adjective>dearest
            wife</adjective>. Thus he roamed about in <adjective>misery</adjective> for some years, and
        at length came to the desert where rapunzel , <characteristic depiction="maternal">with the twins to which she had given birth, a
            boy and a girl</characteristic>, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it
        seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, rapunzel knew him
        and fell on his neck and wept.Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before.
        <autonomy level="male_savior">He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received</autonomy>, and they lived for a long time
        afterwards, happy and contented.</p>
