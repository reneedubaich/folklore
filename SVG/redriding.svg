                little girlloved by every one who looked at herthere was nothing that she would

            walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the

            wolf.Cake and wine; yesterday was
                baking-dayA good quarter of a league farther on in the wood;
                her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you
                surely must know it,What a
                    tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful—she will be better to eat than the old

                nosegay; that would please her tooso she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still
                prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the
                wood.whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still

                I am too weak, and cannot
                    get
            up.
            Little Red-Cap, however, had
                been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could
                carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to
                her.

                her.I like being with grandmother so
            muchOh! grandmother, she said, what big
                ears you have!
            The better to hear you with, my child, was the reply. But,
                grandmother, what big eyes you have! she said. The better to see you
                with, my dear.
            But, grandmother, what large hands you have!
            The better to hug you with.
            Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!
            The better to eat you with!When the wolf
                had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to
                snore very loudjust as he was going to fire at him, it
            occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmotherRed-Cap, however, quickly fetched
                great stones with which they filled the wolf’s
            body
                As long as I live, I will never by myself
                    leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do
                        so.mother has forbidden me to do
                        so Red-Cap, however,
                was on her guard, and went straight forward on her
            waythe
            grandmother saw what was in his thoughtsI made some sausages yesterdaythe smell of
            the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out
            his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped
            down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was
        drownedRed-Cap went joyously home, and never did anything
            to harm any one<text x="66" y="-570" text-anchor="middle">Red Riding
