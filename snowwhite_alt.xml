    <title> Maria, the Wicked Stepmother, and the Seven Robbers </title> 
    Once upon a time there was
    a man whose wife died, and he had only a <adjective gender="female">little</adjective> daughter, whose name was Maria. Maria went to
    school to a woman who taught her sewing and knitting. In the evening when she left for home the
    woman would always say to her, <quote> Give your father my <adjective gender="female">kindest</adjective> greetings. </quote> Because
    of these friendly greetings the man thought, <quote> She would be a wife for me, </quote> and he
    married the woman. After they were married, <villanization cause = "competition, jealousy" gender = "female"> the woman became very unfriendly toward <adjective gender="female">poor</adjective> Maria,
        for stepmothers have always been that way, </villanization> and with time she could not stand her at all. Then
    she said to her husband, <quote> <automonmy type = "controlled" level = "evil" gender="female"> The girl eats too much of our bread. We will have to get rid of
        her. </automonmy></quote> But the man said, <quote> I cannot kill my child! </quote> Then the woman
    said, <quote> Tomorrow take her with you out into the country and leave her there alone, so that
        she will not be able to find her way back home. </quote> The next day the man called his
    daughter and said to her, <quote> <autonomy type="controlled" level="evil" gender="male">We are going out into the country. We will take something to
        eat with us.</autonomy> </quote> Then he got a large loaf of bread, and they set forth. <autonomy type = "free"> However, Maria
    was clever, and she filled her pockets with bran. As she walked along behind her father, from
    time to time she threw down a little pile of bran onto the pathway. </autonomy> After walking for many hours
    they came to the top of a steep cliff. Her father dropped the loaf of bread over the cliff, then
    cried out, <quote> Oh, Maria, our bread fell down there! </quote>
    <quote> Father, </quote> said Maria, <quote> <autonomy type = "free"> I will climb down and get it. </autonomy></quote> So she
    climbed down the cliff and got the bread, but by the time she had climbed back up to the top,
    her father had gone away, and Maria was all alone. She started to cry, for she was very far from
    home, and in a strange place. But then she thought about the bran and took courage. Following
    the bran, she finally arrived home again, late that night. <quote> Oh, father, </quote> she
    said, <quote> why did you leave me alone? </quote> The man comforted her and talked to her until
    he had reassured her. <villanization cause = "competition, jeanlousy" gender = "female"> The stepmother was very angry that Maria had found the way back,</villanization> and some
    time later she again told her husband that he should take Maria out into the country and abandon
    her in the woods.<autonomy type="controlled" level="evil" gender="male"> The next morning the man called his daughter once again,</autonomy> and they set forth.
    The father again carried a loaf of bread, but <autonomy type = "free" level = "damsel"> Maria forgot to take the bran with her </autonomy>. In the
    woods they came to an even steeper and higher cliff. The father again dropped the bread over the
    edge, and <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "evil"> Maria had to climb down to get it. </autonomy> When she arrived back at the top, her father had
    gone away, and she was alone. She began to cry <adjective gender="female">bitterly</adjective>, and she ran one way and the other for a
    long time, only to find herself even deeper in the dark woods. Evening came, and suddenly she
    saw a light. <autonomy type = "free" level = "damsel"> She walked toward it and came to a little house. Inside she found a set table and
    seven beds, but no people were there. The house belonged to seven robbers. Maria hid behind a
    dough trough </autonomy>, and soon the seven robbers returned home. They ate and drank, and then went to
    bed. The next morning they left, but the youngest brother remained at home in order to cook the
    food and clean the house. After they had left, the youngest brother went out to buy food. Then
    <autonomy type = "free" gender="female"> Maria came out from behind the dough trough, swept and cleaned the house, and then put the
        kettle on the fire in order to cook the beans. Then once again she hid behind the dough trough.</autonomy>
    When the youngest brother returned home he was amazed to see <characteristic stereotype="negative" type="physical" value="domesticity" gender="female" >everything so clean</characteristic>, and when his
    brothers came back, he told them what had happened. They were all astonished and could not
    imagine how it had happened. The next day the second brother remained at home alone. He
    pretended that he too was going away, but he returned at once and saw Maria, who had come out
    once again to clean up the house. <autonomy type="free" level="damsel">Maria was frightened when she saw the robber. <quote> Oh,
    </quote> she begged, <quote> for heaven's sake, do not kill me!</quote></autonomy> 
    <quote> Who are you? </quote> asked the robber. Then she told him about her <characteristic type = "nonphysical" value = "wicked" gender="female"> <adjective gender="female">wicked</adjective> stepmother,</characteristic>
    and how her father had abandoned her in the woods, and how for two days she had been hiding
    behind the dough trough. <quote> <characteristic type = "nonphysical" value="trustworthy" gender="male"> You don't have to be afraid of us, </characteristic></quote> said the robber.
        <quote> Stay here with us and be our sister, and<characteristic stereotype="negative" type="physical" value="domesticity" age="young" gender="female"> cook, sew, and wash for us.</characteristic> </quote> When
    the other brothers returned home, they were satisfied with this, so Maria stayed with the seven
    robbers, did their housekeeping, and was always <adjective gender="female">quiet</adjective> and <adjective gender="female">diligent</adjective>. One day as she was sitting
    by the window sewing, a poor old woman came by and asked for alms. <quote> Oh, </quote> said
    Maria, <quote> <characteristic type = "nonphysical" value="innocence, naive" gender="female"> I don't have much, for I myself am a poor, <adjective gender="female">unhappy</adjective> girl, but I will give you what
        I have. </characteristic> </quote>
    <quote> Why are you so unhappy? </quote> asked the beggar woman. Then Maria told her how she had
    left home and had come here. <villanization cause = "jealousy" gender = "female"> The poor woman went forth and told the <adjective gender="female">wicked</adjective> stepmother that Maria
    was still alive. When the stepmother heard this she was very angry, and she gave the beggar
    woman a ring that she was to take to poor Maria. The ring was a magic ring. Eight days later the
    poor woman came again to Maria to beg for alms, and when Maria gave her something, she said,
        <quote> Look, my child, I have here a beautiful ring. Because you have been so good to me, I
            want to give it to you .</quote> </villanization><autonomy level = "damsel"> <characteristic stereotype="negative" value="innocence, naive" age="young" gender="female">Suspecting nothing</characteristic>, Maria took the ring, but when she put
                it on her finger she fell down dead. </autonomy> When the robbers returned home and found Maria on the
    floor, they were very sad, and they cried bitterly for her. Then they made a beautiful coffin
    and laid Maria inside it, after having adorned her with the most <adjective gender="female">beautiful</adjective> jewelry. They also
    put a large amount of gold in the coffin, which they then set on an oxcart. <autonomy type="free" level="male_savior">They drove the
    oxcart into the city.</autonomy> When they came to the king's castle they saw that the stall door was wide
    open. They drove the oxen inside, in order to bring the cart into the stall. This caused the
    horses to become very uneasy, and they began rearing up and making noise. Hearing the noise, the
    king sent someone down to ask the stall-master what had happened. The stall-master answered that
    a cart had been driven into the stall. No one was with the cart, but on it there was a beautiful
    coffin. The king ordered that the coffin be brought to his room, and there he had it opened.
    <autonomy type = "controlled" level = "male_savior, damsel, female_savior"> When he saw the <adjective gender="female">beautiful</adjective> dead girl inside, he began to cry <adjective gender="male">bitterly</adjective>, and he could not leave
    her. He had four large wax candles brought and had them placed at the four corners of the coffin
    and lit. Then he sent everyone out of the room, barred the door, fell onto his knees before the
    coffin, and wept hot tears. When it was time to eat, his mother sent for him, asking him to
    come. He did not answer at once, but instead wept all the more fervently. Then the <adjective gender="female">old</adjective> queen
    herself came and knocked on the door and asked him to open it, but he did not answer. She looked
    through the keyhole, and when she saw that her son was kneeling next to a corpse, she had the
    door broken down. <characteristic type="physical" value="beauty" age="young" gender="female">However, when she saw the <adjective gender="female">beautiful</adjective> girl, she herself was very moved, and she
    leaned over Maria and took her hand.</characteristic> <villanization cause="jealousy" gender="female">Seeing the beautiful ring, she thought that it would be a
    shame to let it be buried along with the corpse, so she pulled it off.</villanization> Then all at once the dead
    Maria came to life again. </autonomy> The young king said joyfully to his mother, <quote> <autonomy  type="free, controlled" level="male_savior, damsel">This girl shall be
        my wife! </autonomy></quote> The old queen answered, <quote> Yes, so shall it be! </quote> and she
    embraced Maria. <characteristic stereotype="negative" value="domesticity" gender="female"><autonomy type="controlled" level="damsel">Thus Maria became the king's wife,</autonomy> and the queen. They lived joyfully and in
    splendor until they died.</characteristic> </story>
