# Had difficulties differentiating to the computer attribute "type" for autonomy and attribute "type" for characteristic
# As a result, we changed attribute "type" in characteristics to "class". 

# good point, maybe we change to type_autonomy and type_characteristic

# The gender attributes occurs under multiple element so its showing up as an error. Not sure how to fix this - Harper
