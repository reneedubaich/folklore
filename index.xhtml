        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our project! Through our digital research, we examined the representation of
            women via culture and language. Using folklore and commonly known fairytales, we were
            able to determine the valuation of female characteristics and understand these norms in
            a broader societal lens.</p>

            <b>Background</b></h2>
        <p>The gender roles of women have been predominantly enforced as submissive to their male
            counterparts. This arises in real-world structures and, similarily, in the art that is
            produced-- specifically, through literature. Whether explicitly or implicitly, the
            characterizations of women are meant to show female readers how they're "supposed" to
            behave. This is done through the innocence and purification of young, beautiful
            antagonists, while simultaneously villainizing older, more "rigid" women (who happen to
            be past the age of child-bearing). Folktales are a great source to examine how these
            stereotypical norms are presented to readers, as they are well-known stories that arise
            in a range of cultures. By looking at different translations of texts, we were able to
            get a better idea of what female traits are fixed, regardless of culture, and which ones
            are distinctive.</p>

            <b> Research Questions </b>
        </h2>
        <p>Our group's goal was to analyze the ways women are depicted behaving and the implications
            this has on real-world readers. We ask:</p>
        <ul-2>
            <em><li>How do cultural translations of folktales act as a lens on female roles in their
                    respective societies?</li>
                <li>Are women depicted as autonomous or subdued? What is their societal role?</li>
                <li>What are the different female stereotypes that are represented? Does this vary
                    by age?</li>
                <li>What role do men in folktales play?</li>
                <li>How are relationships between women represented?</li>
                <li>What role do maternal and paternal figures play in these stories?</li></em>
        </ul-2>
