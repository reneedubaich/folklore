# Background
Throughout history, the gender roles of women have predominantly been enforced as submissive to their male counterparts. This arises in real-world structures and, similarily, in the art that is produced-- specifically, through literature. Whether explicitly or implicitly, the characterizations of women are meant to show female readers how they're "supposed" to behave. This is done through the innocence and purification of young, beautiful antagonists, while simultaneously villainizing older, more "rigid" women (who happen to be past the age of child-bearing). Folktales are a great source to examine how these stereotypical norms are presented to readers, as they are well-known stories that arise in a range of cultures. 
# Research Questions
Our group's goal is to analyze the ways women are shown to behave and the implications this has on real-world readers. We ask: 
~Are women depicted as autonomous or subdued? What is their societal role? 
~What are the different female stereotypes that are represented? Does this vary by age? 
~What role do the men in folktales play? 
~How are relationships between women represented? 
~What is the role of the maternal figures in these stories? How about paternal? 
~Where does female valuation lie? 
# Methodologies
In order to perform our examination of these texts, each group member chose an renowned folktale from the German Grimm's Fairytale collection. Working with these original translations, we marked up the documents in individual XML files, highlighting attributes such as "stereotypes" "value" "expectation" "appearance" and "type". Then, we found translations from another language, such as Charles Perrault, a french folk translator/writer, and examined the langauge differences. By using the same types of markup in XML files, we were looking to examine the ways this langauge changed from culture-to-culture, and what implications this suggested.
