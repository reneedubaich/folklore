    <title>Little Red-Cap</title>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a <characteristic depiction="innocence">dear little girl</characteristic> who was <characteristic char_type="physical"
            >loved by every one who looked at her</characteristic>, but most of all by her
        grandmother, and <characteristic depiction="maternal"><!-- maternal sacrifice and expectation of mothers -->there was nothing that she would not have
            given to the child</characteristic>. Once she gave her a <menstruation motif= "colorred">little cap of red velvet</menstruation>, which
        <characteristic char_type="physical">suited her so well</characteristic><!-- inevitability of menstruation/female destiny -->that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called “Little
        Red-Cap.”</p>
    <p>One day her mother said to her, “Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a
        bottle of wine; <autonomy auto_type="controlled" level="societal_expectation">take them to your grandmother</autonomy>,
            <characteristic age="old" depiction="dependent">she is ill and weak</characteristic>, and they will do
        her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, <characteristic depiction="innocent" level="societal_expectation"
            >walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path</characteristic>, or you may fall and break
        the bottle, and then <autonomy level="societal_expectation">your grandmother will get
            nothing</autonomy><!-- expectation that women, of any age, will provide for others -->; and when you go into her room, <autonomy level="societal_expectation" depiction="kind"
            >don’t forget to say, ‘Good-morning,’</autonomy> and don’t peep into every corner before
        you do it.”</p>
    <p><quote>I will take great care,</quote> said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave her hand on
        it.</p>
    <p>The <characteristic age= "old" depiction="secluded">grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village</characteristic>, and just as Little
        Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know <villainization gender="male">what a wicked creature he
        was</villainization>, and <characteristic depiction="naivity">was not at all afraid of him</characteristic>.</p>
       <quote>Good-day, Little Red-Cap,</quote> said he.
    <quote><characteristic depiction="innocent">Thank you kindly, wolf.</characteristic></quote>
    <quote>Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?</quote>
    <quote>To my grandmother’s.</quote>
    <quote>What have you got in your apron?</quote>
    <quote>Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.</quote>
    <quote>Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?</quote>
    <quote><characteristic depiction="naivity">A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house
            stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you surely must
            know it,</characteristic></quote> replied Little Red-Cap.
    <p>The wolf thought to himself, <quote><characteristic depiction="innocent" age="young">What a tender young creature!
        what a <characteristic age= "old" depiction="rotten">nice plump mouthful—<autonomy level="controlled">she will be better to eat</autonomy> than the old woman</characteristic></characteristic>.<!-- belief that older women are past fruition and no longer valuable --> I
        must act craftily, so as to catch both.</quote> So he walked for a short time by the side of Little
        Red-Cap, and then he said, <quote>See Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about
            here—<manipulation>why do you not look round?</manipulation> I believe, too, that you do
        not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were
        going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.</quote></p>
    <p>Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through
        the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, <quote>Suppose I take grandmother a
        fresh nosegay; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get
        there in good time;</quote> and <characteristic depiction="innocent">so she ran from the path into the
            wood to look for flowers</characteristic>. And <characteristic depiction="naivity">whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she
            saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and
            so got deeper and deeper into the wood.</characteristic></p>
    <p>Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked at the door.</p>
    <quote>Who is there?</quote>
    <quote>Little Red-Cap,</quote> replied the wolf. <quote>She is bringing cake and wine; open the door.</quote>
    <quote>Lift the latch,</quote> called out the grandmother, <quote><characteristic age="old" depiction="dependent">I am too weak, and cannot get up.</characteristic></quote>
    <p><villainization gender= "male">The wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word he went straight to
        the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her</villainization>. Then <manipulation>he put on her clothes, dressed
            himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.</manipulation></p>
    <p><characteristic depiction="naivity">
            <characteristic depiction="innocent">Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking
                flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she
                remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.</characteristic>
        </characteristic></p>
    <p>She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room,
        she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, <quote>Oh dear! how uneasy I feel to-day,
        and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.</quote> She called out, <quote>Good morning,</quote>
        but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her
        grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.</p>
    <characteristic depiction="naivity"><quote>Oh! grandmother,</quote> she said, <quote>what big ears you have!</quote>
            <quote>The better to hear you with, my child,</quote> was the reply. <quote>But, grandmother, what big eyes
                you have!</quote> she said. <quote>The better to see you with, my dear.</quote> <quote>But, grandmother, what
        large hands you have!</quote> <quote>The better to hug you with.</quote> <quote>Oh! but, grandmother, what a
        terrible big mouth you have!</quote> <quote>The better to eat you with!</quote></characteristic>
    <p>And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed
        up Red-Cap.</p>
    <p>When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began
        to snore very loud. <autonomy level= "male_savior">The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, <quote>How
            the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.</quote></autonomy> So he went into the room,
        and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. <quote><autonomy level="religious">Do I find thee here,
            thou old sinner!</autonomy></quote> said he. <quote>I have long sought thee!</quote> Then just as he was going to fire at
        him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that
            <autonomy level="male_savior">she might still be saved</autonomy>, so he did not fire,
        but <maternity_motif>took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he
        had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and
        the little girl sprang out</maternity_motif>, crying, <quote><menstruation motif= "coming of age">Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside
            the wolf;</menstruation><!-- possible reading of sex/rebirth? --></quote> and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to
        breathe. <characteristic depiction="clever">Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with
            which they filled the wolf’s body</characteristic>, and when he awoke, he wanted to run
        away, but the stones were so heavy that he fell down at once, and fell dead.</p>
    <p>Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and went home with it;
        the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but
        Red-Cap thought to herself, <quote><characteristic depiction="obedient" level="societal_expectations">As long as I live, I will never
            by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my <characteristic
                depiction="maternal">mother has forbidden me to do so<!-- mother as demanding figure, influential --></characteristic>.</characteristic></quote></p> *
    * * * * * * <p>It is also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old
        grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. <chracteristic
            depiction="obedient">Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on
            her way</chracteristic>, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had
        said <quote>good-morning</quote> to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that <villainization gender= "male">if they had not
        been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up</villainization>. <quote>Well,</quote> said the
        grandmother, <quote>we will shut the door, that he may not come in.</quote> Soon afterwards the wolf
        knocked, and cried, <quote>Open the door, grandmother, I am little Red-Cap, and am fetching you
            some cakes.</quote> But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or
        thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Red-Cap went
        home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But
            <characteristic depiction="protective"><!-- protective AS maternal! -->the grandmother saw what was in his
            thoughts</characteristic>. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the
        child, <quote>Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which
        I boiled them to the trough.</quote> Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then
        the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last
        stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip,
        and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But <characteristic
            depiction="innocent">Red-Cap went joyously home, and never did anything to harm any
            one</characteristic>.</p>
